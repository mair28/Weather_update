Weather Update Application
This is a simple weather application that allows users to get current weather information and a 3-hour weather forecast for any city. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and forecast details. It also includes the functionality to get weather data for the userâ€™s current location using geolocation.

Key Changes:
Weather container styling with auto-scroll for longer content:

.weather-container {
    background-color: rgb(56, 128, 223);
    padding: 30px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    width: 90%;
    max-height: 700px;
    overflow-y: auto;
}

Flex container for forecast items:
.forecast-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding-top: 20px;
    overflow-x: auto;
}

How to Run:

Open index.html in a browser.
Enter a city name and click "Get Weather", or click "Get Weather By Location" for geolocation-based weather data.

Dependencies:
